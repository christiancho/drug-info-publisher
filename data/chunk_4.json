There are no human data on chronic baricitinib exposure throughout pregnancy.

Consider the risks and benefits with chronic use of OLUMIANT during pregnancy.</p><p>In animal embryo-fetal development studies, oral baricitinib administration to pregnant rats and rabbits at exposures equal to and greater than approximately 11 and 46 times the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) of 4 mg/day, respectively, resulted in reduced fetal body weights, increased embryolethality (rabbits only), and dose-related increases in skeletal malformations. No developmental toxicity was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits treated with oral baricitinib during organogenesis at approximately 2 and 7 times the exposure at the MRHD, respectively. In a pre- and post-natal development study in pregnant female rats, oral baricitinib administration at exposures approximately 24 times the MRHD resulted in reduction in pup viability (increased incidence of stillborn pups and early neonatal deaths), decreased fetal birth weight, reduced fetal body weight gain, decreased cytotoxic T cells on post-natal day (PND) 35 with evidence of recovery by PND 65, and developmental delays that might be attributable to decreased body weight gain. No developmental toxicity was observed at an exposure approximately 5 times the exposure at the MRHD <span class=\\\"Italics\\\">(see Data)</span>.</p><p>The background risks of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population(s) are unknown.

JAKs are intracellular enzymes which transmit signals arising from cytokine or growth factor-receptor interactions on the cellular membrane to influence cellular processes of hematopoiesis and immune cell function. Within the signaling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription (STATs) which modulate intracellular activity including gene expression. Baricitinib modulates the signaling pathway at the point of JAKs, preventing the phosphorylation and activation of STATs.</p><p>JAK enzymes transmit cytokine signaling through their pairing (e.g., JAK1/JAK2, JAK1/JAK3, JAK1/TYK2, JAK2/JAK2, JAK2/TYK2). In cell-free isolated enzyme assays, baricitinib had greater inhibitory potency at JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 relative to JAK3. In human leukocytes, baricitinib inhibited cytokine induced STAT phosphorylation mediated by JAK1/JAK2, JAK1/JAK3, JAK1/TYK2, or JAK2/TYK2 with comparable potencies. However, the relevance of inhibition of specific JAK enzymes to therapeutic effectiveness is not currently known.</p></section>\",\n            \"contraindications\": \"<section class=\\\"Section\\\" data-sectioncode=\\\"34070-3\\\"><a name=\\\"s34\\\"></a><a name=\\\"section-3\\\"></a><p></p><h1>4 CONTRAINDICATIONS</h1><p class=\\\"First\\\">None.</p></section>\",\n            \"highlights\": {\n                \"dosageAndAdministration\": \"<div><p class=\\\"Highlighta\\\">Administration Instructions: </p><ul class=\\\"Disc\\\"><li>See the full prescribing information for recommended evaluations and immunizations prior to treatment.
