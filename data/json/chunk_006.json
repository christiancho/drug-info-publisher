Some published literature suggests that IL-17A directly promotes cancer cell invasion, suggesting a potential beneficial effect by TALTZ, whereas other reports indicate IL-17A promotes T-cell mediated tumor rejection, suggesting a potential adverse effect by TALTZ. However, neutralization of IL-17A with TALTZ has not been studied in these models. Depletion of IL-17A with a neutralizing antibody inhibited tumor development in mice, suggesting a potential beneficial effect by TALTZ.
