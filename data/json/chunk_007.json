The molecule is a fusion protein that consists of 2 identical, disulfide-linked chains, each containing an N-terminal GLP-1 analog sequence covalently linked to the Fc portion of a modified human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) heavy chain by a small peptide linker and is produced using mammalian cell (Chinese hamster ovary) culture. The GLP-1 analog portion of dulaglutide is 90% homologous to native human GLP-1 (7-37). Structural modifications were introduced in the GLP-1 part of the molecule responsible for interaction with the enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase-IV (DPP-4). Additional modifications were made in an area with a potential T-cell epitope and in the areas of the IgG4 Fc part of the molecule responsible for binding the high-affinity Fc receptors and half-antibody formation. The overall molecular weight of dulaglutide is approximately 63 kilodaltons."
